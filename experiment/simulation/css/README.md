<b style="font-size: 1.6em; color: black;">Gear Manufacturing Simulation - Documentation</b>

This directory contains the interactive simulation module for **Gear Extrusion** and **Bevel Gear Forging**.

### Process Overview
1. **Gear Extrusion:** A red billet is pushed by a yellow punch through a green die to form spur gear teeth through plastic deformation.
2. **Bevel Gear Forging:** A two-step closed die forging process where an initial billet is shaped into a straight bevel gear using intermediate and final die stages.

### Interactive Navigation
The `index.html` interface uses a vertical navigation stack with **Call to Action** prompts:
- Users are prompted to choose between setup observations, strain analysis, and force-displacement curve studies.
- Only one active simulation is displayed at a time to optimize focus and system performance.

### Files
* **index.html:** Interactive user interface.
* **css/main.css:** Modern stylesheet for vertical alignment and video cards.
* **Videos:** Links to 6 raw MP4 simulations hosted on GitHub.
