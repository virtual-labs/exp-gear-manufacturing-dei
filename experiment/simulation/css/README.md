# Experiment 3: Gear Manufacturing - CSS & Resources

This folder contains the styling and simulation documentation for **Gear Extrusion** and **Bevel Gear Forging**.

## Contents
- `main.css`: Stylesheet designed to provide a clean, "no-underline" interface for simulation videos and technical descriptions.
- `index.html`: The primary simulation interface embedding 6 videos categorized by setup, strain analysis, and graphical data.

## Process Overview
The simulations cover two primary manufacturing methods:
1. **Extrusion:** Forming spur gear profiles by pushing billets through a shaped die.
2. **Step Forging:** Creating straight bevel gears using a two-step closed die forging process.
