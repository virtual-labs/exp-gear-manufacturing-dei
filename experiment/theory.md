A gear is a rotating machine part having cut teeth, or cogs, which mesh with another toothed part in order to transmit torque. Two or more gears working in tandem are called a transmission and can produce a mechanical advantage through a gear ratio and thus may be considered a simple machine. Geared devices can change the speed, torque, and direction of a power source.

Extruding is used to form teeth on long rods, which are then cut into usable lengths and machined for bores and keyways etc. Nonferrous materials such as Aluminium and Copper alloys are commonly extruded rather than steels. This result in good surface finishes with clean edges and pore free dense structure with higher strength.
