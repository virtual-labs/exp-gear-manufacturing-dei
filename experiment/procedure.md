Follow the steps below to conduct the virtual experiment and analyze the extrusion and forging processes used in gear manufacturing.

<br>

<b style="font-size: 1.2em;">1. Understanding Gear Geometry and Objective</b>
First, study the basic concept of gears from the **Theory** section. Observe how gears transmit torque, speed, and motion between shafts. Identify the importance of accurate tooth formation and surface finish in gear performance through the extrusion process.

<br>

<b style="font-size: 1.2em;">2. Gear Extrusion – Setup Observation</b>
* **Action:** Play the simulation **“Gear Extrusion: Setup”**.
* **Observation:** Observe the extrusion arrangement where the billet (red) is placed inside the extrusion die (green). The punch (yellow) applies compressive force. 
* **Analysis:** Notice how the material flows into the die cavity as the punch moves downward, engraving the gear teeth into the billet via plastic deformation.



<br>

<b style="font-size: 1.2em;">3. Gear Extrusion – Strain Distribution Analysis</b>
* **Action:** Run the simulation **“Gear Extrusion: Strain Analysis”**.
* **Observation:** Observe the strain contours developed during the process. 
* **Technical Note:** Note how maximum strain occurs near the gear teeth region due to intense material flow. Compare the color variations with the strain scale to understand the deformation behavior across the gear profile.

<br>

<b style="font-size: 1.2em;">4. Gear Extrusion – Force vs Displacement Study</b>
* **Action:** Observe the simulation **“Gear Extrusion: Force vs Displacement Graph”**.
* **Data Analysis:** Analyze the graph plotted between Force on Punch (Tonnes) and Pilot Height (mm). 
* **Observation:** Note the increase in force requirement as the punch progresses, which indicates the resistance offered by the billet as it fills the complex gear tooth geometry.

<br>

<b style="font-size: 1.2em;">5. Bevel Gear Forging – Step 1 Formation</b>
* **Action:** Play the simulation **“Bevel Gear: Forging Step 1”**.
* **Observation:** Observe the first stage of bevel gear formation. The upper yellow die moves downward while the lower green die remains stationary. 
* **Analysis:** Watch the billet undergo plastic deformation to reach an intermediate "preform" shape.



<br>

<b style="font-size: 1.2em;">6. Bevel Gear Forging – Step 2 Final Shaping</b>
* **Action:** Run **“Bevel Gear: Forging Step 2”**.
* **Observation:** The intermediate billet obtained from Step 1 is further compressed.
* **Inference:** This second step achieves the final bevel gear geometry, ensuring accurate tooth formation and the dimensional precision required for mechanical transmission.

<br>

<b style="font-size: 1.2em;">7. Bevel Gear – Strain and Graph Interpretation</b>
* **Action:** Finally, observe **“Bevel Gear: Strain and Graph Analysis”**.
* **Observation:** Study the strain distribution and note that maximum strain (reaching values up to 3.36107) occurs near the gear teeth edges. 
* **Analysis:** Analyze the strain variation graph to understand deformation intensity and material flow, correlating high strain with improved mechanical properties and grain refinement in the gear teeth.
